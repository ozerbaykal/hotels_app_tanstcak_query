# Hotels App (TanStack Query)

## Project Overview

Hotels App is a full-stack hotel management application built with React and Node.js, utilizing TanStack Query for efficient API data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend. The backend server, developed with Node.js, uses data.json to simulate database operations for hotel data management. The application provides users with the ability to browse hotels, view hotel details, and create new hotel entries with dynamic filtering and sorting capabilities.
